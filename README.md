# Meetup Presentations Columbus Chapter

## Setup

- A folder is dedicated for each meetup presentation     
- Folder name includes presentation date in 6 digit year-month-day format  without separators (i.e. `190202` for Feb 2nd 2019),     
followed by `_` and a short name describing the session.       
- Each new meetup presentation is added as `Header2` to `README.md` following `Setup`, letting newest session be on top.      
- Add presenter's name, short description and directory (in this repo) for each presentation section.
